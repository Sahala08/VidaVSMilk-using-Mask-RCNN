# VidaVSMilk-using-Mask-RCNN
The Repository is dependent on the algorithm of Mask R-CNN and it can use to detect vida(one brand of draw out tissue) and milk(vita milk). Address of Mask R-CNN  is https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN. 
* Notice: we use the google colab to download, test, train, evaluate, visualize the model.  

# Download the weights 
Addressï¼šhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1HZ9i7IvWW7uSMMODVvPw7pHgKGjK5lKD/view?usp=sharing
Please download it and place on your repository root directory.

# Getting Started
* milkvsvida_demo.ipynb (in samples folder) : Is the easiest way to start. It shows an example of using a model pre-trained on VidaVSMilk dataset (which is calibration by VIA) to segment objects in your own images.
* milkvsvida_0604.ipynb (in samples/milkvsvida folders) : shows how to train Mask R-CNN on VidaVSMilk dataset. 
* detection_0614.ipynb (in samples folder) : shows how to test on VidaVSMilk dataset and compute mAP
* model.py, utils.py, config.py: These files contain the main Mask RCNN implementation.

# Installation
Example is shown in samples/milkvsvida/maskrcnn_download.ipynb.
